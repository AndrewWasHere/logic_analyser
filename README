Arduino Logic Analyser
Written by Andrew Lin, May, 2011

An internal logic analyser for Arduino. This class is meant to be added to Arduino sketches during development
to probe the digital pins of the Arduino, much as an external logic analyser would. To use, add LogicAnalyser.cpp
and LogicAnalyser.h to an Arduino sketch, and create and instance of the LogicAnalyser class.
